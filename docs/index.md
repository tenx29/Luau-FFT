# About Luau FFT

Luau FFT is an open-source module for calculating discrete Fourier transforms on Roblox. The module includes an object-oriented implementation of complex numbers to assist with the required calculations.

!!! info
    Basic understanding of Luau and object-oriented programming is assumed in this documentation.

!!! danger "Performance notice"
    The Fourier transform is a very time-intensive task, so it is not recommended to use this on Roblox for real-time applications with very large input tables.
